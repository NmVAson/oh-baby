# **ðŸ“š Essential Baby Books**

### **"What to Expect When You're Expecting" (and "The First Year" & "The Second Year")**
These books are my *Bibles*. Seriously. If thereâ€™s a question youâ€™ve Googled at 2 a.m. (*"Is this weird, or is it just me?"*), this book has an answer. Or five.

**Why I Love It:**
- Itâ€™s like having an ultra-reliable, slightly nerdy but super supportive friend who calmly explains *everything*.
- It breaks down each stage of pregnancy, postpartum, and your kiddoâ€™s early years in bite-sized chunksâ€”so you donâ€™t have to read a whole chapter to figure out what to do when you sneeze-pee or when your babyâ€™s going through *yet another* growth spurt.
- The "First Year" and "Second Year" books cover the chaos of milestones, weird baby behaviors, and the "Is this normal?!" moments.

*Warning:* Itâ€™s so thorough that it might freak you out a little at first. But remember: not every possible symptom means disaster. Sometimes, itâ€™s just gas.

### **"Cribsheet" by Emily Oster**
This book is like a warm hug for your anxious brain and a no-nonsense pep talk at the same time. Emily Oster takes all the messy, conflicting parenting advice and breaks it down with data (but in a fun wayâ€”not the boring science class way).

**Why I Love It:**
- Sheâ€™s hilarious and realâ€”no preachy vibes here.
- Every "hot take" youâ€™ve heard from relatives (*"Co-sleeping is dangerous!"* vs. *"Co-sleeping saved my life!"*)? Oster lays out the actual stats and lets *you* decide what makes sense.
- Thereâ€™s no shame, no judgmentâ€”just facts, options, and the reassurance that youâ€™re already doing great.

*Bonus:* This is a great book to hand your partner when theyâ€™re asking "but why are we doing this again?"

### **"Baby Sign Language Made Easy" by Lane Rebelo**
This book saved my sanity when my baby decided she was *done* with non-verbal communication but couldnâ€™t quite speak yet. Baby sign language bridges that frustrating gap, and itâ€™s also the cutest thing ever.

**Why I Love It:**
- It gives you simple, easy-to-learn signs that cover everyday stuff like *"milk,"* *"more,"* *"all done,"* and *"help."*
- The illustrations make it easy to understand, even if you have the attention span of a sleep-deprived parent (*been there*).
- The moment your baby signs *"thank you"* or *"I love you"*? Pure magic.
